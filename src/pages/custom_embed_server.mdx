# Custom Embedding Server

This guide will demonstrate how to build a custom embedding server for the Arguflow API. This will allow you to use your own models for generating embeddings and not use OpenAI.

## Prerequisites

- A server with a GPU is required to run the custom embedding server. If you do not have access to a GPU, you can use a cloud service such as [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
- Python 3.9
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
- [HuggingFace Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/installation.html)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/installation/)

## Step 1: Create a new Python file

Create a new Python file called `embedding_server.py` and import the following packages:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
import torch
```

## Step 2: Load the model

Load the model and tokenizer. For this example, we will use the `bert-base-uncased` model.

```python
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
```

## Step 3: Create the Flask app

Create the Flask app and add a route for the `/embed` endpoint. This endpoint will be used to generate embeddings for the Arguflow API.

```python
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/embed", methods=["POST"])
def embed():
    return jsonify({"embeddings": []})
```

## Step 4: Generate embeddings

Now we can generate embeddings for the Arguflow API. The Arguflow API will send a POST request to the `/embed` endpoint with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "sentences": ["This is the first sentence.", "This is the second sentence."]
}
```

We can use the `sentences` field to generate embeddings for each sentence. We will use the `bert-base-uncased` model to generate the embeddings.

```python
@app.route("/embed", methods=["POST"])
def embed():
    sentences = request.json["sentences"]
    inputs = tokenizer(sentences, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    embeddings = outputs.last_hidden_state.detach().numpy().tolist()
    return jsonify({"embeddings": embeddings})
```

## Step 5: Run the server

Now we can run the server and test it out. Run the following command to start the server:

```bash
python embedding_server.py
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
* Serving Flask app 'embedding_server' (lazy loading)
* Environment: production
* Debug mode: off
* Running on http://
```

Now we can test the server by sending a POST request to the `/embed` endpoint. You can use the following command to test the server:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"sentences": ["This is the first sentence.", "This is the second sentence."]}'
```

You should see the following output:

```json
{
  "embeddings": [
    [
        [
            -0.3405719699859619,...
        ],
    ]
  ]
}
```

## Step 6: Call the API from the Arguflow API

Now that we have a custom embedding server, we can use it to generate embeddings for the Arguflow API. To do this, we need to update the `.env` file to use the custom embedding server. Open the `.env` file and update the `embedding_server` field to use the custom embedding server:

```python
EMBEDDING_SERVER_CALL = <Link to embedding server>
```
