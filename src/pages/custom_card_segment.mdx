# Custom Card Segmenter

This guide will demonstrate how to build a custom card segmenter for the Arguflow API. This will allow you to use your own models for segmenting cards and not use OpenAI.

## Prerequisites

- A server
- Python 3.9

## Step 1: Create a new Python file

Create a new Python file called `card_parser.py` and import the following packages:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import json
import re
```

## Step 2: Create the card parser

Create a class called `CardParser` and add a method called `parse`. This method will take in a string of HTML and return a list of cards.

```python
class CardParser:
    def parse(self, html):
        return []
```

## Step 3: Create the card parser

Now we can parse the HTML and extract the cards. We will use the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML and extract the cards.

```python

class CardParser:
    def parse(self, html):
        soup = BeautifulSoup(html, "html.parser")
        cards = []
        return cards
```

## Step 4: Extract the cards

Now we can build a custom segmenting algorithm to extract the cards. For this example, we will use the following algorithm:

1. Find all the `<h2>` tags in the HTML.
2. For each `<h2>` tag, find the next `<h2>` tag.
3. Extract the text between the two `<h2>` tags.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until there are no more `<h2>` tags.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

class CardParser:
    def parse(self, html):
        soup = BeautifulSoup(html, "html.parser")
        cards = []
        for h2 in soup.find_all("h2"):
            card = {}
            card["title"] = h2.text
            card["content"] = ""
            next_h2 = h2.find_next("h2")
            while next_h2:
                card["content"] += next_h2.text
                next_h2 = next_h2.find_next("h2")
            cards.append(card)
        return cards
```

## Step 5: Run the card parser

The way the Arguflow API works with the card parser is by using CLI args to pass in the path to the html file and reading the stdout from the script.

Add the following code to the bottom of the file to run the card parser:

```python

if __name__ == "__main__":
    parser = CardParser()
    input_file = sys.argv[1]

    with codecs.open(input_file, "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
        html_string = file.read()

    cards = parser.parse(html_string)
    json_output = json.dumps(cards, default=lambda x: x.__dict__)

    sys.stdout.write(json_output)
```

## Step 6: Make Arguflow API work with custom card parser

Now that we have a custom card parser, we can use it to parse the cards for the Arguflow API. To do this, we need to update the `.env` file to use the custom card parser. Open the `.env` file and update the `card_parser` field to use the custom card parser:

```python
PARSER_COMMAND = <Path to card parser>
```
